This page outlines the prerequisites for building and deploying more complex smart contracts in UPCX. Before getting into the advanced smart contracts development workflow, try the [Hello World Smart Contract](#) in the _Getting Started Guide_ to understand the basic workflow of smart contracts development in UPCX.

To build smart contracts with different functionalities, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- [Run a Blockchain](10_running-a-blockchain.md)

Once you have understood these then look at the [Smart Contract Guide](../introduction.md) for details about smart contract development.
