# Key Features

## Usability

No matter how advanced a blockchain's features are, if the platform is not user-friendly, it will fail to achieve mass adoption and will ultimately become a failed project. The primary focus of UPCX is not on achieving the highest levels of security or scalability, but rather on creating a platform that is easy to use and accessible to a broad audience.

**Faster Than Traditional Systems**

In existing blockchain-based payment systems, users often experience significant delays compared to traditional payment methods. For instance, Bitcoin transactions can sometimes take over 24 hours to complete, leading to a poor user experience.

With UPCX, users can escape these delays. Transactions on the UPCX blockchain are completed in just **0.5 seconds**, allowing users to see the transaction finalization almost immediately after pressing the send button. Although there may be some limitations based on network environment or regional characteristics, even in extreme cases such as transactions from the South Pole to the North Pole, the processing time will never exceed **1 second**.

This rapid processing speed is a breakthrough in blockchain technology and represents a major innovation in terms of usability.

**Named Account**

Traditional blockchain addresses are typically long strings of numbers and letters, making them difficult for users to remember or enter correctly. There is also the risk of sending funds to the wrong address due to errors. To address this issue, UPCX offers **Named Accounts**, allowing users to set a simple and memorable name (e.g., email addresses, usernames, or nicknames) as their blockchain wallet address.

The core of Named Accounts is the ability for users to assign a **human-readable name** to their wallet address. For example, a user might choose a name like "john.doe" or "mywallet123" for their wallet. This name can then be used for sending and receiving transactions. However, if the chosen name is already in use on the blockchain, it cannot be registered again, similar to how email addresses work, preventing duplication.

This feature provides a more intuitive payment experience, making the platform accessible even to users unfamiliar with blockchain technology. By eliminating the need to remember complex addresses, transactions become simpler and user-friendly.

In conclusion, Named Accounts enhance the accessibility of the blockchain, providing a more user-centric platform that facilitates easier and more intuitive transactions.

## Scalability

UPCX effectively addresses the scalability issues faced by existing blockchain networks. Traditional blockchain platforms often struggle with increased transaction volumes, leading to slower processing speeds and higher fees, which limit their scalability. UPCX overcomes these limitations through a combination of **hybrid consensus algorithms** and **advanced sharding technology**, significantly enhancing the platform's scalability.

**High TPS (Transactions Per Second)**

UPCX offers a significantly higher TPS compared to traditional blockchain systems, which typically handle only a few dozen to a few hundred transactions per second. UPCX is designed to process **over 100,000 transactions per second (TPS)**. This is not just a theoretical claim; tests conducted using a network of **35 node servers** have successfully demonstrated the systemâ€™s capability to exceed 100,000 TPS in a real-world environment.

This high transaction throughput ensures a stable and fast transaction experience for both large-scale businesses and individual users. It meets the needs of high-speed processing required in real-time payments and large-scale e-commerce. This performance level demonstrates that UPCX is a high-performance blockchain platform suitable for global business and financial services.

The high TPS capability of UPCX allows users to process transactions simultaneously without experiencing delays or network congestion, greatly enhancing the overall user experience.

**Sharding**

UPCX leverages **sharding technology** to maximize the scalability of the blockchain network. Sharding divides the blockchain into multiple smaller segments, or **shards**, that can independently process transactions in parallel. This approach significantly increases the network's overall transaction processing capacity. As the number of users in the network increases, sharding helps distribute the processing load, maintaining high TPS without performance degradation.

UPCX's sharding system is particularly distinguished by its innovative design. While most existing sharding systems rely heavily on a **Beacon Chain** for synchronization, this dependence can lead to reduced TPS due to the centralized bottleneck. UPCX minimizes the reliance on the Beacon Chain, allowing each shard to operate independently with high autonomy while maintaining compatibility across shards.

This combination of independence and efficiency maximizes network performance and prevents the performance degradation typically seen as the network scales. This design makes UPCX a scalable platform capable of handling high transaction volumes and supporting global financial services more effectively.

## Cost Efficiency

UPCX stands out for its exceptional **cost efficiency** compared to traditional blockchain and financial systems. Cost efficiency is primarily achieved through **low transaction fees**, **efficient processing**, and **cost reductions facilitated by enhanced scalability**.

UPCX offers significantly **lower transaction fees** compared to traditional blockchain networks. In conventional blockchain systems, transaction fees often increase as network traffic grows, with users competing to prioritize their transactions by paying higher fees. UPCX addresses this issue by maintaining a **fixed, low fee structure**, minimizing the cost burden for small or frequent transactions.

The high TPS capacity of UPCX ensures that **network congestion or panic scenarios** do not arise, eliminating the need to prioritize transactions based on fees. All transactions are processed **in the order they are received**, preventing fee escalation even as transaction volumes increase. Users only need to pay fees proportional to the size of their transactions.

This system is especially beneficial for users requiring **small payments** or **frequent transactions**, providing a cost-effective and efficient transaction environment. UPCX is an ideal solution for individuals and small businesses needing to process low-value transactions frequently without incurring high costs.
