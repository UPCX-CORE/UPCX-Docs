# 04. Design Principles

The design and development of the UPCX platform are guided by several core principles that provide direction for responding to technological advancements and user requirements. Here, we outline four main principles that will serve as guidelines for future development phases.

## **User-Centric Design**

The primary goal of UPCX is to develop blockchain technology that is easily accessible to all users. It is crucial to minimize the complexity of blockchain addresses and transaction processes, providing an intuitive user interface that anyone can navigate. New features should be designed with the user experience in mind, prioritizing the actual needs of users. Future updates and feature enhancements should be guided by user feedback, aiming for continuous improvement focused on user satisfaction.

## **Scalability**

UPCX must ensure that its current performance of 100,000 TPS (Transactions Per Second) can be sustained even as the number of users and transaction volumes increase. As more shards are added, it is critical to enhance the **compatibility** between shards. The focus should be on strengthening **data transmission and processing capabilities** across shards, ensuring seamless interactions even as the network scales.

To achieve this, UPCX should continuously research and adopt new **distributed processing technologies** while maximizing **data management efficiency**. As the network complexity increases with additional shards, it is essential to maintain the independence of each shard while ensuring efficient cross-shard transaction processing. This is particularly important for handling **large-scale transactions** required in global financial systems and large-scale payment applications.

## **Interoperability**

UPCX must maintain seamless interoperability not only between different blockchain networks but also with existing financial systems. It is crucial to develop features that enable connectivity between various blockchains, such as cross-chain technology, while also establishing and maintaining standards for APIs and SDKs that facilitate integration with traditional financial systems. By doing so, UPCX can connect with diverse financial ecosystems, support more use cases, and play a vital role in the global financial network.

## **Security**

Continuous enhancement of **security** is a key design principle for UPCX. The focus should be on securely protecting user and transaction data while preparing for new threats that may arise with technological advancements. Research and development of future-oriented security solutions, such as **quantum-resistant encryption**, are essential to provide a safe environment for users to conduct transactions. Additionally, UPCX must establish proactive update mechanisms and vulnerability detection systems to maintain the reliability of the blockchain network, ensuring users can trust the platform.
