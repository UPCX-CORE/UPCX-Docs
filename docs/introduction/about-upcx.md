# About UPCX

Blockchain Optimized for Financial Industry

UPCX is a blockchain-based open-source payment system that aims to become the de facto standard for next-generation payment systems.

The key features of UPCX are practical performance and scalability comparable to credit card and mobile payment systems, as well as fast settlement finality.

UPCX solves various problems faced by traditional electronic payment methods such as credit/debit cards and mobile payment, as well as existing blockchains such as bitcoin, and provides multiple functions that take full advantage of their features.

The core features are User Issued Assets, which anyone can quickly issue, and Market Pegged Assets (MPAs), which link Stablecoins to legal tender or commodities.

All assets can be settled and transferred using UPCX wallet. Multiple-asset settlements and transfers are possible between the same assets, or different assets. In addition, users can freely trade them at any time on UPCX DEX.

Business services require a variety of payment methods. With UPCX Financial Smart Contract, you can use Smart Contracts such as Scheduled Payment, Recurring Payment, Automatic Withdrawal, Non-Custodial Escrow Services, and Multi-Signature Authorization Payment.

Users can customize these Smart Contracts to create payment scenarios, taking full advantage of the blockchain power of Smart Contracts to support a wide range of increasingly sophisticated and complex payment and financial services.

We are actively developing dedicated POS apps, terminals, and other hardware to facilitate business and integrate with Crypto ATMs (including the development of proprietary systems). We will also support third parties by providing APIs and SDKs that allow users and operators to take advantage of UPCX seamlessly.

In terms of security, we will implement a cold wallet to secure users' assets and a quantum computer-resistant cryptographic algorithm to respond quickly to the threats of the coming age of quantum computers.

The high reliability, scalability, and flexibility of UPCX provide the opportunity to freely customize payment methods and services to meet the various needs of any business.
