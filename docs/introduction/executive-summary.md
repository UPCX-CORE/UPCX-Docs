# Executive Summary

Technological innovations and the rapid proliferation of digital devices have led to many innovative advances, especially in payments and financial services. Online and mobile payments have enabled individuals to access financial services virtually anywhere, making money transfers and payments more accessible and secure. These technologies have facilitated the growth of the digital economy and made systems and societies more profitable and efficient for businesses and consumers alike.

The world is evolving faster and with greater sophistication and complexity than we can imagine, and the need for more sophisticated and developed payment methods is becoming ever more critical.

Blockchain and crypto assets have long been touted as practical solutions for the next generation of payment methods. Various types of blockchains, various crypto assets, and related services have emerged and diversified as promising means to solve multiple problems in traditional payment methods.

On the other hand, their impact on traditional payment methods is still limited, and valuable services still need to take root.

One reason is that many blockchains are not designed to be as efficient in payment applications as traditional payment methods such as credit cards, mobile payments, and online payments.

Many existing blockchains are inferior to traditional payment methods concerning processing capacity. It is necessary to achieve payment processing capabilities equal to or better than conventional payment methods to make blockchain payment available to online stores and shops.

TPS and settlement finality are the most critical factors for a successful payment process.

- TPS

TPS (Transaction Per Second) is the maximum volume of transactions that can be completed in a given period and is essential for the timely and efficient completion of settlement. The block size, block approval time, and average message size of the transaction determine the TPS under the blockchain specification. Insufficient TPS can significantly increase settlement times, leading to delays and inefficiencies in the settlement process.

- Settlement Finality

Settlement Finality is the foundation of trust between the two parties involved in a transaction and ensures the security of the asset. It allows assets to be securely transferred from one user to another without risk of manipulation or fraud. Finality generally means a settlement is unconditional, irrevocable, and finally completed.

TPS and Settlement Finality are critical elements for successful and efficient transaction settlement.

As cashless payments increase, so do the number of payment transactions. A typical mobile payment system will process a few hundred to just over a thousand transactions. A major credit card company's system can process an average of several thousand (4,000 to 6,000) to a maximum of 50,000 transactions.

On the other hand, a typical blockchain TPS is only a few to a few dozen transactions. The limited TPS of Bitcoin and Ethereum has become a significant issue as the number of users and applications built on top of them has increased.

For example, during the peak of the crypto bull run in 2017-2018, Ethereum's network became congested, leading to a significant increase in fees and longer confirmation times. This congestion made the network difficult for some users and highlighted the need for a more scalable solution.

Various scaling solutions are being researched and developed daily for leading blockchains to address scalability issues, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

High-speed blockchains capable of processing more transactions are also emerging. High-speed blockchains aim to increase throughput while maintaining the security and decentralization features of blockchains.

However, the ability to process large numbers of transactions is not enough to be used for payment and financial services.

Another essential component of payments and financial services is Settlement Finality. Typical blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have not been able to provide the settlement finality required for payment and financial services.

In the case of credit card payments, there is a certain time lag between entering the PIN and removing the card. Similarly, in the case of mobile payments using QR codes, there is a certain time lag before the user or store reads the code and completes the payment.

It is because in-store procedures using payment services still need to be completed at the in-store terminal but only after receiving approval from the core system of that payment system. However, with conventional payment methods, this time lag is only a few seconds.

On the other hand, a typical blockchain cannot complete payment in a few seconds like traditional payment methods.

When Bitcoin is used for store payments, it takes 10 minutes for the payment transaction to be transmitted to and approved by the blockchain, the core of the payment system. This is because the bitcoin block generation interval is set to 10 minutes. This means that at least 10 minutes of waiting in front of the payment terminal for a transaction is impractical. Ethereum and other typical blockchains require seconds to minutes or even tens of minutes or more for approval. If the blockchain lacks sufficient processing power, even more time is needed if transactions are intensive.

And approval on the blockchain does not mean that the settlement is confirmed.

The time required for the blockchain to achieve settlement confirmation depends on the specific blockchain and its protocols. Settlement Finality in a blockchain is when a transaction is considered irreversible and cannot be undone or reversed.

In a blockchain, there is a confirmation process where transactions are added to a block, which is then verified by nodes on the network. The number of confirmations required before a payment is complete also varies from blockchain to blockchain. However, generally, the more guarantees a transaction has, the more secure it is.

For example, in Bitcoin, it is generally recommended to wait for at least six confirmations before deeming a payment confirmed. That is because each time a new block is added to the blockchain, the level of security increases, making it increasingly difficult to undo a transaction.

Major blockchains rely on probabilistic agreement mechanisms called "Proof-of-Work" (PoW) and "Proof-of-Stake" (PoS). While these mechanisms have proven effective in securing the network and preventing double-spending attacks, they are not designed to guarantee payment finality.

Because of these issues, blockchain has yet to be used for payments despite its touted high potential in payment and financial services.

Because of these issues, blockchain has not been used yet in payment and financial services despite its touted high potential.

As a blockchain specifically designed for payments and financial services, UPCX uses different consensus mechanisms and protocols that enable faster and more efficient payment finalization and achieves performance comparable to traditional payment instruments.

UPCX offers not only its high processing power and rapid settlement finality but also a Financial Smart Contract that enables more advanced and convenient payment and financial services. In an increasingly complex and sophisticated society, the Financial Smart Contract is a powerful tool for the next generation of payment and financial services.

Other products include the Wallet App, which can be easily operated by anyone, hardware to facilitate business use, and Blockchain Oracle, which enables seamless interoperability between UPCX blockchain and non-blockchain systems.
