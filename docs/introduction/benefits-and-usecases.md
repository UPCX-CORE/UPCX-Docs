This can help to improve the overall efficiency and accessibility of payment and financial services, which is beneficial for both businesses and individuals.

The key benefit of UPCX is its ability to process transactions much faster than traditional decentralized systems. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to settle transactions, making payment and financial services more convenient for individuals, and help businesses to grow and serve more customers, without reducing the efficiency of their payment and financial services.

## Accelerated globalization and its impact

The world is rapidly accelerating globalization. The world is becoming increasingly connected as technological advances promote cultural exchange and the movement of people and goods at unprecedented speeds. Globalization is accelerating in many ways: international trade is expanding, global digital service companies are emerging, and immigrant workers are rising. As the world becomes more interconnected, it will have many impacts on how we live and interact.

Globalization has the potential to create more significant economic opportunities as countries become more open to trade and investment. As markets become more connected and goods and services are exchanged more freely, the business will expand, and job creation opportunities will increase. In addition, more accessible access to information and technology will help the information society better serve the needs of businesses and people.

On the other hand, globalization also has the potential to create more significant divisions and disparities. Cultural differences and language barriers create misunderstandings and miscommunications, further dividing people.

As globalization progresses, we need to consider its implications and try to bridge existing economic, social, and cultural divides. Globalization can be a powerful force for positive change, but it is important to actively work to ensure that this change leads to greater equality and prosperity.

UPCX will solve various problems that society faces as it evolves.

## International Remittance of Migrant Workers

The number of migrant workers is increasing for various reasons, including labor shortages, economic opportunities, globalization, migration policies, and personal preferences.

International remittance of migrant workers using conventional payment methods often face several challenges. The most significant problems are the transfer fee and the time it takes to complete the transfer.

Conventional remittance services, such as banks and money transfer operators (MTOs), often charge high fees for international transfers. These fees can significantly reduce the amount of money received by migrant workers' families, particularly for smaller transactions.

International transfers using conventional methods can take several days to be completed, causing delays in the funds being available to the recipient. This can be problematic when the recipient needs the money urgently.

In addition to the above, in many developing countries, access to conventional banking services may be limited, particularly in rural areas. This can make it difficult for recipients to collect the transferred funds, requiring them to travel long distances to access a bank or MTO. And these methods often exclude underbanked populations, who may not have access to the necessary financial services to send or receive remittances.

Blockchain has been expected to solve many problems for international remittances for migrant workers, but there are still some challenges and limitations that prevent it from being a completely practical solution.

Major Blockchain often faces scalability issues, particularly when transaction volumes are high. This can result in network congestion and increased transaction fees, which could undermine the cost and speed advantages of using Blockchain.

Generally, Blockchain-based remittance platforms use cryptocurrencies to facilitate transactions. Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, leading to fluctuations in value that could impact the final amount received by the beneficiary. This risk may deter some users from adopting these platforms for international remittances.

To solve this problem, there are services such as real-time conversion offered by cryptocurrency exchanges. In this method, the sender uses cryptocurrency and the receiver receives it in the legal tender of his/her country. The prerequisite for using the real-time conversion service is that there must be a reliable service provider in the recipient's country.

Naturally, a service provider such as a cryptocurrency exchange is in the middle, so a certain fee must be paid to the service provider. In addition, the time required for the process varies depending on the service provider, and it will take some time before the received funds become available.

As a result, this method is not considered very effective for the international remittance of migrant workers.

A more convenient alternative to real-time conversion services is to use stablecoins.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable price. They were developed to take advantage of the benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as decentralization and low cost while reducing the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies.

The value of stablecoins is typically linked to an asset such as gold or the U.S. dollar, ensuring that its value remains relatively stable over time. This means that the recipient does not have to worry about the volatility of cryptocurrencies, as it is equivalent to receiving a transfer in legal tender.

Currently, there are many different types of stablecoins issued and their total market value exceeds several trillion yen.

However, not all stablecoins can solve the problem.

Many stablecoins are built on existing blockchain networks, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, which have their own scalability limitations. These networks can face congestion, leading to slower transaction times and higher fees, which may be particularly problematic for small-value remittance transactions.

Even if the recipient successfully receives the stablecoins, it is usually necessary to change the stablecoins into the legal tender of their country. This is because the penetration rate of payments in stablecoins is still very low. The reason for this is that most stablecoins do not meet the performance requirements of current payment and financial services.

The infrastructure supporting stablecoins transactions needs to be able to handle large volumes of users and transactions simultaneously. This includes not just the blockchain network, but also the wallets, exchanges, and other services that facilitate stablecoins use.

Therefore, a typical stablecoin must be converted to its own currency, and the recipient bears the time, effort, and fees to do so.

UPCX's high throughput and stablecoins functionality can solve these problems and dramatically improve the convenience of international remittances for migrant workers.

In addition, UPCX offers the same level of payment completion as traditional payment methods. In other words, as the UPCX ecosystem expands, recipients will be able to use the funds they receive without having to convert them into their home country's legal tender.

UPCX has the potential to be a game changer in the international remittance landscape for migrant workers and their families.

Protecting the Interests of Labor-Exporting Countries

These efficiencies also benefit the countries receiving overseas remittances, especially labor-exporting countries.

Overseas migrant workers from various countries often use SWIFT-based international remittance solutions when sending overseas remittances (township remittances), paying very high remittance fees.

If the remittance fee were to be 3%, the country receiving the overseas remittance would lose US$100 billion x 3% = US$3 billion (paid to intermediaries in other countries as international remittance fees), which is a very large loss.

UPCX can also protect the interests of these countries by reducing the cost of remittances for overseas migrant workers.

## Cross-Border E-Commerce

The proliferation of cross-border e-commerce platforms has made it convenient and easy for companies and consumers to obtain goods worldwide. On the other hand, rampant fraud and counterfeit products within cross-border e-commerce have become a significant problem.

E-commerce platforms must adopt advanced technologies such as AI and Big Data to increase transaction security and safety to protect consumers, detect and mitigate fraud, and create a more secure e-commerce environment for effective cross-border transactions.

Payment systems must recover funds associated with fraudulent transactions and reimburse customers quickly to maintain trust in e-commerce platforms and consumers. Both parties are spending enormous amounts of money and effort on increasing fraudulent transactions each year.

Credit and debit cards are very convenient payment tools for global transactions.
However, in many cases, when a customer is a victim of fraud or unauthorized transactions, a lot of time and effort are required to deal with the problem.

In general, most e-commerce platforms require a resolution between the buyer and seller when fraud or problems occur in transactions other than those involving items sold by the service operator. First, the fraudulent or dishonest seller will not refund the money, and the buyer will suffer the loss.

An escrow service is one of the best ways to resolve these issues. An escrow service is a service in which a neutral third-party company takes payment from the buyer and transfers the money to the seller after confirming from the buyer that the goods have been delivered and services have been rendered correctly without any problems.

While escrow services are very convenient, service providers may need to obtain the appropriate licenses for each country or region. Therefore, using regular escrow services for cross-border EC is not practical. In addition, the procedures are complex, and fees are relatively high due to the wide variety of processes involved. The credibility of the escrow service provider is also an essential factor.

UPCX offers Non-Custodial Escrow as a Financial Smart Contract, a core feature of the blockchain. Non-Custodial Escrow makes buying and selling goods and services safer across borders.

Non-Custodial Escrow can provide even greater security and reliability in cross-border e-commerce. Unlike traditional escrow services, Non-Custodial Escrow does not require the escrow service provider to hold any funds during the transaction.

The funds are locked into a Smart Contract managed by UPCX, not the buyer or seller. Non-Custodial Escrow provides greater security for buyers and sellers by eliminating the risk of mismanagement or misuse of funds by third-party escrow service providers.

Non-Custodial Escrow also offers flexibility in terms of dispute resolution. With traditional escrow services, the service provider is responsible for resolving disputes between the buyer and seller. However, Non-Custodial Escrow allows disputes to be resolved through arbitration by independent arbitrators appointed by the buyer and seller without a centralized authority. Non-Custodial Escrow enhances trust between the parties by ensuring that disputes are resolved fairly.

Non-Custodial Escrow also reduces the cost of cross-border transactions. Since Non-Custodial Escrow does not require a third party to hold the funds, the cost to the buyer and seller is significantly reduced.

Non-Custodial Escrow reduces the risk of fraud and disputes in cross-border e-commerce transactions and increases confidence between the buyer and seller parties.

## Cross-Border Business Transaction

As globalization accelerates, increasingly, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) increasingly turn to overseas markets for their business opportunities. As the cross-border business grows and matures, so does the need for practical payment solutions for global transactions.

For SMEs, the problems with cross-border payments are: difficult to understand, unexpected costs, high fees, and complex processes.

Letters of credit (L/C) are the most effective and secure means of international payment. But they are cumbersome for SMEs, and their cost is reasonable. And SMEs may need more resources and know-how to complete the process efficiently.

Another problem is that banks charge fees for issuing and administering letters of credit, which can be a significant burden as the costs can be higher for SMEs, which may be considered high transaction risk. As a result, some companies have shied away from using L/C's and have turned to other payment methods, such as wire transfers and open account transactions, which also have risks and problems.

Wire transfers are the electronic transfer of funds from one bank account to another, usually via the SWIFT network. Generally considered secure and reliable, but with high fees and settlement times of several days. The infrastructure of the SWIFT network moves funds from one payment system to another through a series of internal book transfers between financial institutions. Because data transfers occur between various systems with low levels of coordination, funds settle slowly and are prone to errors. To overcome these weaknesses, the next generation of SWIFT services is also emerging. Users have highly evaluated the new system for its improved transfer times and error rates compared to the old system. However, from the standpoint of financial institutions, participation in the SWIFT network remains challenging and requires hefty participation fees. The primary source of those costs is overseas remittance fees; therefore, the fees paid by companies are not reduced compared to the former SWIFT network.

Open account transactions are inherently more suited to long-term, ongoing business relationships with a high degree of trust between the buyer and seller. It can facilitate the payment process for the buyer and seller and reduce transaction costs, but it also carries risks for both parties, such as credit risk for the seller and default on payment by the buyer.

UPCX can solve many of the problems associated with cross-border transactions. One of UPCX's core innovative services is Financial Smart Contract, a self-executing contract program that automatically initiates payments when certain conditions are met. A smart Contract is a self-executing contract program that can automatically initiate payments when certain conditions are met. Financial Smart Contracts are UPCX's proprietary financial services-specific Smart Contracts. These Smart Contracts can be customized to create an alternative to L/C settlement based on multiple conditions. Financial Smart Contracts include Non-Custodial Escrow, which allows parties to execute an escrow agreement without depositing funds with a third party, and Scheduled Payment, which automatically makes payments on a specified date.

UPCX also offers Multi-Signature transaction execution management to increase security for business organizations. That means that multiple authorized persons can manage the execution of payments, money transfers, and changes to account settings. That prevents unauthorized transactions within the business organization.

## Global QR Code Payment Service

QR code payment services are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide because payment can be made simply by scanning the code with a smartphone. However, using QR code payment services is fragmented, with different systems adopted in different countries and regions and often incompatible with each other. This fragmentation creates inefficiencies and hinders the growth of the global digital payments market.

One solution to this problem is to use blockchain technology to unify these disparate systems.

A global network of interoperable payment systems could be created by linking different QR code payment services with blockchain. Individuals would then be able to use their preferred QR code payment service when traveling to other countries without registering for a new service or using a different payment method.

A single interoperable system that leverages blockchain technology would ensure transaction security and transparency, eliminate the need for banks and other intermediaries, reduce transaction fees, and speed up payments.

The high performance of UPCX allows for the rapid processing of large volumes of transactions around the world. The immediate completion of payments is comparable to that of QR code payment services in your country. UPCX's multiple-asset system also enhances the user experience and simplifies the payment process.

Although unifying QR code payment services with blockchain technology will require cooperation and coordination among different countries, regions, and payment providers, it will provide users with a convenient and efficient payment experience that will transform the global digital payment market.

## Highly Complex Society

## The Emergence of the Metaverse

With the advent of the Metaverse, society is becoming more complex and multilayered.

Metaverse is a term used to describe a virtual reality space or collective virtual shared space where users can interact with computer-generated environments and each other through avatars and other digital representations. A futuristic concept developed by various high-tech companies, it is envisioned as a fully immersive 3D digital world that can be accessed anytime, anywhere.

In the Metaverse, users can participate in various activities such as gaming, socializing, shopping, attending events, and even working or studying. It is expected to become a massive online platform connecting people and companies worldwide and providing new opportunities for business, entertainment, education, and social interaction.

The Metaverse is constantly evolving and becoming more integrated with more advanced technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality to provide more immersive and interactive experiences, blurring the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds and becoming more and more integrated into real life.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency have the potential to play a significant role in the further evolution of the Metaverse.

Blockchain allows users to securely own and transfer digital assets without intermediaries such as banks or other financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies can be used as currency in the Metaverse, allowing users to trade digital assets and services, such as purchases, sales, and subscriptions, and to make micropayments that are difficult with traditional payment methods. One of the benefits of Blockchain in the Metaverse is its ability to provide ownership of digital assets in the Metaverse and a secure and transparent transaction system.

Blockchain will also contribute to creating a decentralized governance system in the Metaverse. As the Metaverse grows, it will need a plan to manage the rules and regulations that guide its operations. A governance system based on Blockchain can provide a decentralized and transparent decision-making process that is not subject to a central authority. Crypto assets can be used as rewards and incentives to encourage users to participate and engage in the Metaverse's decentralized governance system and community.

The decentralized identity capabilities of the Blockchain allow users to create and manage their own digital identities and control the data they share with others. That is especially important in a metaverse where users must interact and trust each other through avatars.

Blockchain interoperability enables interoperability between different metaverse platforms, allowing users to move their digital assets and avatars between other virtual worlds. One of the most important aspects is that blockchain P2P payments and transfers are safe, secure, highly transparent, and fast, no matter which Metaverse each user resides in.

The integration of Blockchain and Metaverse provides new opportunities for ownership, governance, security, and interoperability in the Metaverse. It will enable the creation of new types of digital assets that can be traded and exchanged between the same and different metaverses, providing a more secure and transparent means for users to participate in the metaverse economy.

However, the current state of major Blockchains presents specific scalability issues that need to be resolved for the Metaverse to reach its full potential.

While digitization is increasing the volume of digital transactions in the real world, the Metaverse and the multiverses and omniverse that will undoubtedly come shortly will have their world 100% digital, and all transactions will be digital. As the Metaverse grows, its transaction volume will be enormous.

The main scalability issue with existing blockchains is their limited transaction processing capacity. That means that as more and more users join the Metaverse, the blockchain network may be unable to handle the increased transaction volume, leading to delayed confirmation times and higher transaction fees.

UPCX has high processing power that can smoothly handle the large number of ton transactions that occur in the Metaverse. It also provides the level of prompt payment completion required for payment, remittance, and exchange of game items.

UPCX provides a variety of practical means in addition to the smooth processing of large transaction volumes, such as stablecoins and proprietary tokens, which can be used as the base currency, community currency, incentive points, and so on within the Metaverse. These cryptocurrencies can be seamlessly traded within the same Metaverse and across different Metaverses.

Within the Metaverse, various communities and decentralized governance structures will be formed. UPCX can also seamlessly process payments and transfers between multiple currencies. And it does not matter if it is between different metaverses or between the real world and the Metaverse via XR.

UPCX can also be used for entertainment, such as live shows and sporting events in the Metaverse, which is expected to become more prevalent in the future, as well as for money pitches and NFT events at events where the Metaverse and the real world are merged.

UPCX's Financial Smart Contract enables secure and transparent transactions and payments for various businesses operating in the Metaverse. In-game transactions, metaverse shopping, and other new business activities that merge the real world and the Metaverse require more complex and sophisticated payment methods.

Financial Smart Contract is Programmable Money that allows you to build the best payment scenario for your transactions and business.

UPCX can solve various challenges required in the new form of the world that will soon arrive.

## Digital Transformation for Society and Economy

Digital Transformation (DX) is the process of using digital technology to fundamentally change how an organization operates and delivers value to its customers. DX aims to build more efficient, innovative, and customer-centric business models that can adapt to the rapidly changing digital environment. DX is increasingly seen as essential for long-term business success in the digital age, helping to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and create new revenue streams. DX is increasingly seen as crucial to long-term business success in the digital age, helping to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and create new revenue streams.

Blockchain can support DX processes by enabling secure, transparent, and efficient digital transactions. Blockchain can also facilitate automating processes such as identity verification, contract management, and payment processing, reducing costs and improving efficiency. It has the potential to enable new business models that can flexibly respond to changing customer needs, leading to increased innovation and competitiveness.

Secure, reliable, low-cost, and universally accessible payment systems facilitate social and economic DX, leading to economic development and increased social benefits.

## Payment Infrastructure of Super Apps

A super app is a mobile application that integrates multiple services and functions, such as messaging, social networking, e-commerce, payment processing, ride-hailing, and food delivery, within a single platform. Super apps are becoming increasingly popular, especially in emerging markets, because they offer a convenient and seamless user experience by integrating multiple services and functions into a single app.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency can bring various benefits to super apps as payment infrastructure. Blockchain-based payment systems allow users to send and receive payments securely and efficiently within the Super App platform. Blockchain technology can provide a secure and transparent payment infrastructure, allowing users to send and receive payments without traditional intermediaries such as banks or payment processors. That is expected to reduce transaction costs, increase transaction speed, and give users greater control over their financial data.

Cryptocurrencies can be used as a universal medium of exchange within the Super App. Cryptocurrencies can facilitate cross-border transactions, allowing users to send and receive payments in different currencies without the need for traditional bank intermediaries. That helps reduce the complexity and cost of cross-border transactions and is especially important for super apps that operate in multiple countries.

Blockchain can provide enhanced security and privacy for super app users. Using a blockchain-based payment infrastructure, users can maintain control over their personal and financial data, and blockchain's decentralized and tamper-proof nature protects transactions. That protects user privacy and prevents fraud and hacking.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency bring many advantages to the super app as a payment infrastructure, including a secure and efficient payment system, a universal medium of exchange, and enhanced security and privacy. As super apps grow in popularity, blockchain and cryptocurrencies will play an increasingly important role in facilitating a seamless and convenient user experience on these platforms.

It is expected that super-apps will appear in various fields in the future, and several existing applications will be integrated and renewed as new super-apps. In particular, social networking-related applications such as Twitter and Facebook declare themselves super-apps to build new revenue models and improve the user experience. Global SNS services have more than 100 million members. If multiple giant SNS services use blockchain as a super-application payment infrastructure, the volume of transactions will be enormous; a characteristic of SNS is that when certain events occur, many messages are generated intensively. For example, a social networking app allows users social tipping. In that case, many transactions will be generated instantaneously during a World Cup soccer game or an entertainment event.

Major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, can only handle small transactions. The large number of transactions occurring simultaneously also means that fees will skyrocket.

UPCX's multi-currency system enhances the global super-apps' user experience and simplifies the payment process. UPCX can quickly process large numbers of transactions from all over the world. UPCX's ability to complete payments immediately also gives it an advantage in events linked in real time to NFTs and social tipping.
