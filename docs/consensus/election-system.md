# Election-Based Mechanism of DPoS

The standout feature of DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) is its **election-based mechanism**, where network participants vote directly to elect **Witnesses** or **Block Producers (BPs)**. This process maintains the network’s democratic nature and decentralization while enabling efficient transaction validation and block creation.

## DPoS Election Process

In a DPoS system, **token holders** are granted voting rights. Each token carries voting weight, allowing users to vote for their preferred candidates as **Witnesses/BPs**. This process is crucial for network governance and validator selection, giving users a direct role in managing the network.

The candidates with the highest number of votes are selected as **Witnesses/BPs**, who are responsible for block creation and transaction validation, ensuring the network’s integrity and stability. If a **Witness/BP** engages in malicious behavior or fails to perform reliably, users can vote them out and elect a new validator.

The voting process is **continuous**, with **re-elections** occurring at regular intervals. For UPCX, **re-elections take place every 24 hours**, allowing users to vote for new **Witnesses/BPs** using their UPC coins. This frequent election cycle ensures **transparency**, **fairness**, and adaptability to changes in network conditions.

In DPoS, a user’s **voting power** is proportional to the amount of tokens they hold. While this increases network security and deters malicious actions, safeguards are implemented to prevent large stakeholders from gaining excessive control, ensuring fair governance.

## UPCX’s DPoS Election System

UPCX’s **DPoS-based election system** allows users to actively participate in network governance and block production. With re-elections every 24 hours, users can use their UPC coins to vote for new **Witnesses/BPs**. This system is a cornerstone of UPCX’s **transparency**, **decentralization**, and **scalability**, enabling users to contribute to the network’s growth and stability.

The DPoS election system in UPCX fulfills the requirements of a next-generation blockchain platform by enabling rapid transaction validation, robust security, democratic governance, and energy efficiency.

## **Lockup of Voting Assets**

One of the potential problems in a DPoS system is **malicious voting attacks**, where some users temporarily acquire assets to vote, win an election, and then immediately sell off the assets. This behavior can distort network governance and negatively impact long-term stability.

To mitigate this issue, UPCX implements a **Voting Asset Lockup** mechanism, requiring users to lock up the assets used for voting for a specific period.

- **Lockup Period**:
  The UPC coins used for voting cannot be sold immediately; they are locked for a duration set by network policy, typically matching the **re-election cycle (e.g., 24 hours)** or longer.
- **Ensuring Long-Term Governance Stability**:
  By locking voting assets, UPCX prevents sudden market fluctuations and governance manipulation. Voters must commit to their decisions, contributing to the network’s long-term stability.
- **Enhanced Transparency**:
  The lockup of voting assets is publicly recorded on the blockchain, allowing participants to verify that the voting process is fair and reducing the potential for malicious actions.

UPCX’s **Voting Asset Lockup** mechanism addresses the vulnerabilities of the DPoS system, protecting the network from malicious voting attacks. This mechanism enhances the fairness of the election process, ensures the network’s long-term stability, and encourages responsible participation in governance. Through this approach, UPCX realizes a democratic and decentralized blockchain network.
