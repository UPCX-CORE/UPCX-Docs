# Reward System

The UPCX blockchain distributes the fees collected in the **Fee Pool** as various rewards to support the network's maintenance and growth. The Fee Pool, where transaction fees are initially deposited, plays a crucial role in sustaining the network's operations and incentive system.

## **Rewards for Block Producers (Witness/BP)**

A portion of the fees in the Fee Pool is allocated to the **Block Producers (Witness/BP)**. These participants are responsible for creating blocks and verifying transactions, ensuring the integrity of the network. The rewards act as an incentive for the validators to maintain stable operations and perform their roles diligently.

## **Rewards for MPA Issuers**

When an **MPA (Market Pegged Asset)** is used to pay transaction fees, a portion of these fees is allocated to the **MPA Issuers**. This compensation provides economic incentives for the issuers who manage and maintain the stability of the MPA assets, ensuring they have the motivation to uphold the assetâ€™s value and reliability.

## **Rewards for Workers**

The UPCX blockchain features a role known as **Worker**, who is responsible for **error correction and network improvement tasks**. Workers address issues such as bug fixes, network upgrades, and performance optimizations, enhancing the stability and reliability of the blockchain.

- **Proposal System for Workers**:
  UPCX allows Workers to submit proposals outlining their tasks to the network. Users can vote on these proposals, and upon approval, rewards are distributed from the Fee Pool. This system enables network participants to oversee Worker activities and contribute to network development through a democratic process.
- **Significance of Worker Rewards**:
  Rewards for Workers provide economic motivation to those handling the technical maintenance of the network, supporting continuous improvement and development. This mechanism plays a vital role in ensuring the long-term stability of the network.

The economic structure of UPCX provides strong incentives for network participants and flexibility to support diverse business applications. By implementing a **low-fee model**, staking rewards, a multi-asset system, and the **voting asset lockup mechanism**, UPCX aims to build a sustainable economic ecosystem. This approach benefits both users and developers, realizing a blockchain platform that supports broad user engagement and long-term growth.
