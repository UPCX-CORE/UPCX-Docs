# 05. How UPCX Works

The UPCX platform is designed to be a next-generation blockchain capable of handling global electronic asset transactions. To achieve this, UPCX utilizes a **shard-based** architecture with a central **Beacon Chain** ensuring compatibility between shards. Each shard operates independently, distributing transaction processing capabilities to maximize scalability. This design allows the network to handle high transaction volumes without compromising performance.

The UPCX network employs a **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** consensus algorithm. Each shard is managed by a committee of **7 Witnesses**, who are elected every 24 hours. Users can participate in the voting process by staking their **UPC coins**, allowing them to play an active role in network governance and maintain a high level of decentralization.

UPCX also features a **smart contract** system, enabling users to create and utilize financial contracts within the shards. Users can develop **local smart contracts** that function only within a specific shard or **global smart contracts** synchronized across all shards. This provides customized financial services and complex contract functionalities.

To support this infrastructure, UPCX offers several key products:

## UPCX Wallet

The **UPCX Wallet** is an essential tool for interacting with the UPCX network, offering a variety of formats to enhance user experience. It includes **Web Extension Wallet**, **Android & iOS Wallet**, **Web Wallet**, and **Cli Wallet**, each tailored for specific user needs and environments.

The **Web Extension Wallet** is the most commonly used wallet, similar in functionality to Metamask, and facilitates dApp development and user transactions. It operates as a browser extension, allowing seamless interaction with the UPCX blockchain. This enables developers to easily integrate UPCX into their dApps.

The wallet also supports the **Named Account** feature, allowing users to create wallet addresses using memorable names instead of complex blockchain addresses. This significantly improves user experience, making it easier for those unfamiliar with blockchain technology to engage with the platform.

Furthermore, the wallet supports **multi-asset management**, enabling users to handle various assets such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in a single wallet. The **QR code payment** feature also allows users to make payments conveniently in mobile environments, enhancing usability in everyday transactions and offline retail settings.

UPCX Wallet combines user-friendly features with robust security, simplifying interactions within the UPCX network.

## API and SDK

UPCX provides **APIs and SDKs** to facilitate seamless integration of blockchain functionalities for developers and businesses, enabling a wide range of applications to connect with the UPCX blockchain.

The currently available SDK is **UPCX-JS** for **JavaScript**, allowing developers to easily interact with the UPCX network. UPCX-JS is well-suited for developing web applications or dApps, supporting various functionalities such as blockchain transactions, smart contract calls, and wallet integration.

In the future, UPCX plans to release additional SDKs for **Linux**, **Windows**, and **iOS**, as well as SDKs for various programming languages. This will enable broader adoption of the UPCX blockchain by developers and streamline the integration of financial services, payment systems, and fintech applications.

## UVM Runner

The **UVM Runner** is a core component that provides an environment for executing **smart contracts** on the UPCX blockchain. Based on the UPCX Virtual Machine (UVM), the UVM Runner allows users to execute and test smart contracts before deploying them to the blockchain.

With the **UVM Runner**, users can simulate smart contract execution in a test environment that mimics the actual blockchain runtime. This allows users to test the functionality of their contracts without incurring fees or consuming assets, ensuring predictable outcomes and identifying potential issues before deployment.

The UVM Runner also enables users to efficiently run smart contracts on the web and deploy them directly to the UPCX network when needed. During the development process, users can evaluate the performance, efficiency, and behavior of their smart contract code in real-time, minimizing the risk of errors.

Additionally, a **user-friendly development tool** is provided, allowing users to write and deploy smart contracts in a web-based interface. This feature simplifies the smart contract development process, making it more intuitive and efficient for both developers and users.

## Block Explorer

The **UPCX Block Explorer** is a tool that allows users and developers to view the status of the blockchain, including transactions, block creation, and smart contract activities in real-time. The explorer provides transparency and powerful tracking features, enabling users to monitor all activities on the network.

These components support the technological excellence and user-centric design of UPCX, enhancing its capabilities as a global blockchain platform.
