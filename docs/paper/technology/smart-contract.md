# Smart Contract

A **smart contract** is a digital agreement where the terms are directly encoded into code, making it self-executing. Once agreed upon by all parties, the contract is immediately effective and operates in a decentralized and secure blockchain environment.

Smart contracts are highly appealing across various sectors such as **financial transactions**, **asset management**, **supply chain management**, and **voting systems**. They offer key benefits such as **tamper-proof integrity**, **transparency**, and **irreversibility**. These features eliminate the need for intermediaries like banks or lawyers, saving both time and costs.

When predefined conditions are met, smart contracts automatically execute tasks without requiring human intervention. This automation minimizes risks of **fraud**, **human error**, or **non-compliance**, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of business transactions and agreements.

UPCX smart contracts share similarities with EVM-based contracts and others, yet they stand out with their broad and convenient upgradability features. UPCX smart contracts are categorized into four types:

## **Unverified Contracts**

These are smart contracts where the source code is not shared publicly. While transparency is a hallmark of blockchain, not all use cases require open source. Developers of certain dApps may opt to keep the source code private based on their application's specific needs.

## **Fully-Upgradable Contracts**

These contracts are entirely modifiable. Similar to other blockchains, UPCX smart contracts are assigned unique addresses. If this address is manually generated by the developer, the developer retains control over the contract via a private key. This feature allows developers to fully update smart contracts, addressing a common limitation in blockchains like Ethereum, where modifications to deployed contracts are nearly impossible.

Though this capability raises potential security concerns from a user perspective, it provides developers with significant flexibility, helping prevent issues caused by irreversible mistakes.

## **Partially-Upgradable Contracts**

This model is akin to **Proxy-Upgradable** contracts in EVM. While the core structure and data remain unalterable, functional elements can be updated through a proxy layer. This allows developers to iteratively enhance or fix certain aspects of a contract while preserving its foundational elements.

## **Non-Upgradable Contracts**

These are immutable contracts designed for scenarios where security and reliability are paramount. While offering high user trust, they also require careful design as developers cannot make changes once deployed.

UPCX smart contracts provide a range of flexibility levels to cater to various developer and user requirements while ensuring operational efficiency and trust. This approach makes UPCX a versatile blockchain platform for diverse business and application needs.
