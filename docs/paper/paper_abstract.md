# 01. Abstract

UPC is a blockchain-based open-source payment system designed to become the de facto standard for next-generation payment solutions.

The core features of UPCX include practical performance and scalability comparable to credit card and mobile payment systems, as well as fast **settlement finality**. The platform addresses various issues faced by traditional payment methods such as credit/debit cards and mobile payments, as well as existing blockchains like Bitcoin. It offers multiple functions that leverage the best aspects of these systems.

The main features include **User Issued Assets (UIA)** and **Market Pegged Assets (MPA)**, which are linked to legal tender or commodities. All these assets can be easily transferred and settled using the UPCX wallet. Users can conduct multiple-asset transfers and payments, both within the same asset type or across different asset types. Moreover, users can trade freely on UPCX's decentralized exchange (DEX).

UPCX supports various payment methods via financial smart contracts, such as **Scheduled Payment**, **Recurring Payment**, **Non-Custodial Escrow Service**, and **Multi-Signature Authorization Payment**. These contracts allow users to manage complex financial scenarios efficiently and can be customized to meet diverse business needs.

To enhance business integration, we are actively developing dedicated POS apps, terminals, and other hardware, including integration with cryptocurrency ATMs. Additionally, UPCX will provide APIs and SDKs to help third-party developers seamlessly utilize the platform.

In terms of security, UPCX will implement **cold wallet solutions** to protect users' assets and integrate **quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms** to address potential threats from future quantum computing technologies.

The high reliability, scalability, and flexibility of UPCX allow businesses to freely customize payment methods and services, meeting a variety of needs across different industries.

It must be noted that UPCX is a complex system under active development. Therefore, the contents of this guide and the technologies described may be subject to change. Users and developers should keep up to date with the latest information and regularly review the documentation and technical specifications to ensure they have the most current understanding of the system's capabilities and updates.
